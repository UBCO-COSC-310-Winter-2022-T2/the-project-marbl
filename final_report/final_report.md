# General Development:

 ### **What did your team build? Is it feature complete and running?**
Clack.
 ### **How many of your initial requirements that your team set out to deliver did you actually deliver (a checklist/table would help to summarize)?  Were you able to deliver everything or are there things missing?  Did your initial requirements sufficiently capture the details needed for the project?**
A lot.
 ### **What is the architecture of the system?  What are the key components?   What design patterns did you use in the implementation?  This needs to be sufficiently detailed so that the reader will have an understanding of what was built and what components were used/created.  You will need to reflect on what you planned to build vs what you built.**
Python.
 ### **What degree and level of re-use was the team able to achieve and why?**
High.
 ### **How many tasks are left in the backlog?**
Lots.
# CI/CD:

 ### **What testing strategies did you implement?  Comment on their degree of automation and the tools used.    Would you (as a team) deal with testing differently in the future?  Make sure to ensure that your testing report is updated to reflect what's actually been done.**
 Kanban.
 ### **How did your branching workflow work for the team?  Were you successful in properly reviewing the code before merging as a team?**
 Good.
 ### **How would your project be deployed?  Is it docker ready and tested?  Provide a brief description of the level of dockerization you have implemented and what would be required to deploy.**
 No.

# Reflections (Comment on the following items as a team):

 ### **How did your project management work for the team?  What was the hardest thing and what would you do the same/differently the next time you plan to complete a project like this?**
 Yes. Lorum Ipsum
 ### **Do you feel that your initial requirements were sufficiently detailed for this project?  Which requirements did you miss or overlook?**
 Yes No Yes Lorum Ipsum
 ### **What did you miss in your initial planning for the project (beyond just the requirements)?**

  Lorum Ipsum Lorum Ipsum
 ### **If you were to estimate the efforts required for this project again, what would you consider?  (Really I am asking the team to reflect on the difference between what you thought it would take to complete the project vs what it actually took to deliver it).**  
  Lorum Ipsum  Lorum Ipsum
 ### **What did your team do that you feel is unique or something that the team is especially proud of (was there a big learning moment that the team had in terms of gaining knowledge of a new concept/process that was implemented).**
